title: Scaffolding Validation
summary: |
  A developer builds the cupboard CLI, runs the version command to confirm
  the binary works, and verifies that all standard tables and entity types
  are accessible through the Cupboard and Table interfaces. This is the first
  use case implemented and validates that the type system, interfaces, and
  CLI entry point compile and link correctly before any backend behavior is
  exercised.
actor: Developer who has cloned the repository and wants to confirm that the project compiles
trigger: Running go build on the cupboard CLI and executing the version command
flow:
  - id: F1
    step: "Verify module path and local replace: the go.mod file declares module github.com/mesh-intelligence/crumbs with a replace directive pointing to ./ for local development"
  - id: F2
    step: "Build the cupboard CLI: run go build ./cmd/cupboard; the command must complete without errors producing a cupboard binary"
  - id: F3
    step: "Run the version command: execute cupboard version; the command prints the version string and a list of implemented use cases then exits with code 0"
  - id: F4
    step: "Verify entity structs compile: the build transitively compiles all entity types in pkg/types; each struct must have its documented fields and methods"
  - id: F5
    step: "Verify Table interface compiles: the Table interface must define Get, Set, Delete, and Fetch methods; a compile-time assertion confirms the contract is met"
  - id: F6
    step: "Verify Cupboard interface compiles: the Cupboard interface must define GetTable, Attach, and Detach methods; the SQLite backend must satisfy this interface at compile time"
  - id: F7
    step: "Verify standard table names are defined: the constants CrumbsTable, TrailsTable, PropertiesTable, MetadataTable, LinksTable, and StashesTable must exist in pkg/types"
  - id: F8
    step: "Attach and enumerate tables: create a Cupboard, attach with a temporary directory, and call GetTable for each of the six standard table names; each call must return a non-nil Table without error; detach afterward"
