    use_cases:
      - id: rel01.1-uc001-go-install

        status: done

  - id: rel02.0
    name: Properties with Enforcement
    focus: Implement the property system with automatic initialization and backfill. Every crumb always has a value for every defined property.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel02.0-uc001-property-enforcement
        status: done
      - id: rel02.0-uc002-regeneration-compatibility
        status: done

  - id: rel02.1
    name: Issue-Tracking and Self-Hosting
    focus: Validate cupboard as an issue tracker with CLI commands, benchmarks, and self-hosting. Requires properties (rel02.0) for type, priority, and labels.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel02.1-uc001-issue-tracking-cli
        status: done
      - id: rel02.1-uc002-table-benchmarks
        status: done
      - id: rel02.1-uc003-self-hosting
        status: done
      - id: rel02.1-uc004-metadata-lifecycle
        status: done

  - id: rel03.0
    name: Trails and Stashes
    focus: Implement trail lifecycle for exploratory workflows and stash for shared state coordination. An agent can explore implementation approaches with trails, abandoning failed attempts and completing successful ones.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel03.0-uc001-trail-exploration
        status: done
      - id: rel03.0-uc002-link-management
        status: done
      - id: rel03.0-uc003-stash-operations
        status: done
      - id: rel03.0-uc004-trail-crumb-lifecycle
        status: done

  - id: rel03.1
    name: Post-Trails Validation
    focus: Validate trails functionality with self-hosting scenarios. Agents create trails as epics, add crumbs as tasks, and use trail lifecycle to finalize or discard grouped work.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel03.1-uc001-self-hosting-with-epics
        status: done

  - id: rel99.0
    name: Unscheduled
    focus: Use cases not yet assigned to a release. These will be scheduled as the roadmap evolves.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel99.0-uc001-blazes-templates
        status: not_started
      - id: rel99.0-uc002-docker-bootstrap
