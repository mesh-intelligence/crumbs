  - version: "03.1"
    name: Post-Trails Validation
    status: done
    description: |
      Validate trails functionality with self-hosting scenarios. Agents create
      trails as epics, add crumbs as tasks, and use trail lifecycle to finalize
      or discard grouped work.

      - id: rel03.1-uc001-self-hosting-with-epics

  - version: "99.0"
    name: Unscheduled
    status: not started
    description: |
      Use cases not yet assigned to a release. These will be scheduled as the
      roadmap evolves.
    use_cases:
      - id: rel99.0-uc001-blazes-templates
        summary: Agent Uses Blazes (Workflow Templates)
        status: not_started
      - id: rel99.0-uc002-docker-bootstrap
        summary: Docker Bootstrap (Docs to Working System)
        status: not_started

prioritization:
  - Focus on earliest incomplete release
  - Later use cases can be partially implemented if they share functionality with the current release
  - Each issue should map to a use case in the roadmap
